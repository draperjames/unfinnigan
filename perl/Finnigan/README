Finnigan version 0.02
=====================

This module is part of the Unfinnigan project aimed at decoding
the proprietary data files used to acquire data from Thermo mass
spectrometers. These are are known as "raw" files and they were
intended to be read with proprietary software (Xcalibur) running
on the Windows operating system.

This module allows complete access to scan data without the need
to install any vendor software.

It can decode several recent file formats (versions 57, 62 and 63)
and it comes with a suite of command-line tools that can be used
to examine various elements of the data. One of the tools, uf-mzxml,
replaces ReAdW in the task of converting the Finnigan data to mzXML.

The module and the tools have been tested in an ongoing SILAC
proteomics project, where users are writing their own data analysis
scripts.

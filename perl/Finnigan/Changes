Revision history for Perl extension Finnigan.

0.0207 Sat May 26 23:35:11 BST 2012
        - fixed a null profile bug in Finnigan::Scan
        - added a tentatvie support for multiple RunHeaders. If the file
          contains more than one data stream, the one with a non-zero scan
          events' address will be read, and the other one ignored. That leaves
          the UV sensor data unaccessible.
        - renamed CASInfo -> ASInfo; respectively, uf-casinfo -> uf-asinfo

        - optimisations for speed in all decoder objects
        - new object, Finnigan::Scan, provides a lightweight
          decoder for scan data that takes just two file reads to
          decode the profile and the centroid list.
        - more test coverage; the most essential manoeuvres
          for reading scan data are now represented.
        - complete documentation of all modules

=head1 NAME

Finnigan::InjectionData -- a decoder for the injection parameters in a sequence table row

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Finnigan;
  my $param = Finnigan::InjectionData->decode(\*INPUT);
  $param->dump;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Decodes the data describing the injection that delivered the sample for
analysis to the mass specrometer. The data includes the vial label,
sample volume, weight, internal standard (ISTD) amount, and dilution factor.

Finnigan::InjectionData is a component of Finnigan::SeqRow

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item decode($stream)

The constructor method

=item n

Get the sequence table row number

=back

=head2 MISSING ACCESSORS

Since I had not seen this object used by the programs, I did not worry about providing the complete interface for it. Accessors may be added for:

=over 4

=item volume

=item injected volume

(what's the difference between "volume" and "injected volume"?

=item weight

=item internal standard amount

=item dilution factor

=item a couple other numbers of unknown meaning

=back

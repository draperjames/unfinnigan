=head1 NAME

Finnigan::InstrumentLogRecord -- a decoder for a single Instrument Log record

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $entry = Finnigan::InstrumentLogRecord->decode(\*INPUT, $header->ordered_field_templates);
  use Finnigan;
  my $i = 0;
  foreach my $field ($entry->fields) {
    say $entry->time
      . "\t" . $header->field($i)->label
        . "\t" . $field->{value};
    $j++;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This decoder is prototyped on Finnigan::GenericRecord, which is a
pass-through decorder that only passes the field definitions it
obtains from the header (Finnigan::GenericDataHeader) to
Finnigan::Decoder. It is essentially a copy of the
Finnigan::GenericRecord code with one specific field (retention time)
prepended to the template list.

Because Thermo's GenericRecord objects are odered and may have
"virtual" spacers and section titles in them, the Finnigan::Decoder's
method of stashing the decoded data into a hash is not directly
applicable. A GenericRecord may have duplicate keys and the key order
needs to be preserved. That is why Finnigan::GenericRecord relies on
the B<field_templates> method of Finnigan::GenericDataHeader to insert
ordinal numbers into the keys.

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item decode($stream)

The constructor method

=item time

Get the timestamp. The timestamp is retention time measured in seconds
and stored as floating-point value.

=item fields

Get the list of all fields in the record. Each field is decoded with
the Finnigan::GenericRecord decoder using the definitions from
Finnigan::GenericDataHeader, and it contains, for example, the
following data:

  {
    value => '8.1953125',
    type => 'Float32',
    addr => 803445,
    seq => 70,
    size => 4
  }

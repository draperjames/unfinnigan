Finnigan::Scan -- a lightweight scan data decoder

=head1 SUBMODULES

Finnigan::Scan::Profile

Finnigan::Scan::ProfileChunk

Finnigan::Scan::CentroidList

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $scan = Finnigan::Scan->decode(\*INPUT);
  say $scan->header->profile_size;
  say $scan->header->peak_list_size;

  my $profile = $scan->profile;
  $profile->set_converter( $converter ); # from ScanEvent
  my $bins = $profile->bins;
  my ($mz, $abundance) = @{$bins->[0]} # data in the first bin

  my $c = $scan->centroids
  say $c->count;

  say $c->list->[0]->[0]; # the first centroid M/z
  say $c->list->[0]->[1]; # abundance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This decoder reads the entire ScanDataPacket, discarding the location
and type meta-data. It is a more efficient alternative to the
full-featured combination decoders using the Finnigan::Profile,
Finnigan::Peaks and Finnigan::Peak modules.

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item decode

The constructor method

=item header

Get the Finnigan::PacketHeader object. It is the only full-featured
decoder object used in this module; since it occurs only once in each
scan, there is no significant performance loss.

=item profile

Get the Finingan::Scan::Profile object containing the profile, if it exists

=item centroids

Get the Finnigan::Scan::CentroidList object containing the peak centroid list, if it exists

=head1 NAME

Finnigan::Scan::Profile -- a lightweight decoder for Finnigan scan profiles

=head1 SYNOPSIS
  use Finnigan;

  my $scan = Finnigan::Scan->decode(\*INPUT);
  my $profile = $scan->profile;
  $profile->set_converter( $converter ); # from ScanEvent
  my $bins = $profile->bins;
  my ($mz, $abundance) = @{$bins->[0]} # data in the first bin

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Finningan::Scan::Profile is a lightweight decoder for the Profile
structure. It does not save the location and type information for the
elements it decodes, nor does it provide element-level accessor
methods. That makes it fast, at the cost of a slight reduction in
convenience of access to the data.

It does not do file reads either, decoding part of the stream of
profile chunks it receives as a constructor argument from the
caller. Its full-featured equivalent, Finnigan::Profile, does a file
read for every data element down to a single integer of floating-point
number, which makes it very slow.

Finnigan::Scan::Profile is good for use in production-level
programs that need extensive debugging. In a situation that calls for
detailed exploration (e.g., a new file format), better use
Finnigan::Peaks, which has an equivalent interface.

Every scan done in the profile mode has a profile, which is either a
time-domain signal or a frequency spectrum accumulated in
histogram-like bins.

A profile can be either raw or filtered. Filtered profiles are sparse;
they consist of separate data chunks. Each chunk consists of a
contiguous range of bins containing the above-threshold signal. The
bins whose values fall below a cerain threshold are simply discarded,
leaving gaps in the profile -- the reason for the ProfileChunk
structure to exist.

One special case is raw profile, which preserves all data. Since there
are no gaps in a raw profile, it is represented by a single chunk
covering the entire range of bins, so the same container structure is
suitable for complete profiles, as well as for sparse ones.

The bins store the signal intensity, and the bin co-ordinates are
typically the frequencies of Fourier-transformed signal. Since the
bins are equally spaced in the frequency domain, only the first bin
frequency is stored in each profile header. The bin width is common
for all bins and it is also stored in the same header. With these
data, it is possible to calculate the bin values based on the bin
indices.

The programs reading these data must convert the frequencies into the
M/z values using the conversion function specific to the type of
analyser used to acquire the signal. The calibrated coefficients for
this convesion function are stored in the ScanEvent structure (one
instance of this structure exists for every scan).

The B<bins> method of Finnigan::Scan::Profile returns the converted bins,
optionally filling the gaps with zeroes.

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item new($buffer, $layout)

The constructor method

=item nchunks

Get the number of chunks in the profile

=item set_converter($func_ref)

Set the converter function (f -> M/z)

=item set_inverse_converter($func_ref)

Set the inverse converter function (M/z -> f)

=item bins

Get the reference to an array of bin values. Each array element
contains an (M/z, abundance) pair. This method calls the converter set
by the set_converter method.

=item find_peak_intensity($query_mz)

Get the nearest peak in the profile for a given query value. The
search will fail if nothing is found within 0.025 kHz of the target
value (the parameter set internally as $MAX_DIST). This method
supports the search for precursor intensity in uf-mzxml.

Finnigan::Scan::ProfileChunk -- a lightweight decoder for a single ProfileChunk structure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Finnigan;

  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Finningan::Scan::ProfileChunk is a lightweight decoder for the
ProfileChunk structure, a segment of a Profile. It does not save the
location and type information for the individual list elements, nor
does it provide element-level accessor methods. That makes it fast, at
the cost of a slight reduction in convenience of access to the data.

It does not do file reads either, decoding part of the stream of
profile chunks it receives as a constructor argument from the
caller. Its full-featured equivalent, Finnigan::Peaks, does a file
read for every data element down to a single integer of floating-point
number, which makes it very slow.

Finnigan::Scan::ProfileChunk is good for use in production-level
programs that need extensive debugging. In a situation that calls for
detailed exploration (e.g., a new file format), better use
Finnigan::Peaks, which has an equivalent interface.

Every scan done in the profile mode has a profile, which is either a
time-domain signal or a frequency spectrum accumulated in
histogram-like bins.

A profile can be either raw or filtered. Filtered profiles are sparse;
they consist of separate data chunks. Each chunk consists of a
contiguous range of bins containing the above-threshold signal. The
bins whose values fall below a cerain threshold are simply discarded,
leaving gaps in the profile -- the reason for the ProfileChunk
structure to exist.

One special case is raw profile, which preserves all data. Since there
are no gaps in a raw profile, it is represented by a single chunk

The bins store the signal intensity, and the bin co-ordinates are
typically the frequencies of Fourier-transformed signal. Since the
bins are equally spaced in the frequency domain, only the first bin
frequency is stored in each profile header. The bin width is common
for all bins and it is also stored in the same header. With these
data, it is possible to calculate the bin values based on the bin
indices.

Each ProfileChunk structure stores the first bin index, the number of
bins, and a list of bin intensities. Additionally, in some layouts, it
stores a small floating-point value that most probably represents the
instrument drift relative to its calibrated value; this "fudge" value
is added to the result of the the frequency to M/z conversion. The
chunk layout (the presence or absence of the fudge value) is
determined by the layout flag in PacketHeader.

=head1 NAME

Finnigan::Scan::CentroidList -- a lightweight decoder for PeakList, the list of peak centroids

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Finnigan;

  my $c = Finnigan::Scan::CentroidList->new($buffer);
  say $c->count;
  say $c->list->[0]->[0]; # M/z
  say $c->list->[0]->[1]; # abundance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This simple and lightweight decoder for the PeakList structure does
not save the location and type information for the individual list
elements, nor does it provide element-level accessor methods. That
makes it fast, at the cost of a slight reduction in convenience of
access to the data.

It does not do file reads either, decoding the stream of
floating-point numbers it receives as a constructor argument into an
array of (M/z, abundance) pairs. Its full-featured equivalent,
Finnigan::Peaks, does a file read for each peak, which makes it very
slow.

It is good for use in production-level programs that do not need
extensive debugging. In a situation that calls for detailed
exploration (e.g., a new file format), better use Finnigan::Peaks,
which has an equivalent interface.

=head1 NAME

Finnigan::AuditTag -- a decoder for AuditTag, a substructure found in the Finnigan file headers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Finnigan;
  my $tag = Finnigan::AuditTag->decode(\*INPUT);
  say $tag->time;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AuditTag is a structure with uncertain purpose that contains a
timestamp in Windows format and a pair of text tags. These tags seem
to carry the user ID of the person who created the
files. Additionally, there is a long integer, possibly carrying the
CRC-32 sum of the data file or a portion of it.

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item decode($stream)

The constructor method

=item time

Get the timestamp

=item tag1

Get the value of the first tag. The second tag was found to be
identical in all cases studied, so there is no tag2 accessor, but its
value can be accessed as $obj->{data}->{"tag[2]"}->{value}.

=item stringify

Returns the timestamp followed by the first tag

=head1 NAME

Finnigan::GenericRecord -- a decoder for data structures defined by GenericDataHeader

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Finnigan;
  my $record = Finnigan::GenericRecord->decode(\*INPUT, $header);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Finnigan::GenericRecord is a pass-through decorder that only passes
the field definitions it obtains from the header
(Finnigan::GenericDataHeader) to Finnigan::Decoder.

Because Thermo's GenericRecord objects are odered and may have
"virtual" gaps and section titles in them, the Finnigan::Decoder's
method of stashing the decoded data into a hash is not directly
applicable. A GenericRecord may have duplicate keys and the key order
needs to be preserved. That is why Finnigan::GenericRecord relies on
the B<field_templates> method of Finnigan::GenericDataHeader to insert
ordinal numbers into the keys.
